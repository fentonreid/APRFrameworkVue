# APRFramework Vue
To access the Vue website simply navigate to ***https://aprframework.fentonreid.com/***, it is possible in the future this site will be removed. So the steps to download locally and run on localhost are outlined below.

## Steps
1. First you will need to install Vue.js, follow the instructions here, ***https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html***, requiring you to install Node 15.0 or higher
2. Git clone my repository to a directory of your choosing, using the following command in a command line window, '***git clone https://github.com/fentonreid/APRFrameworkVue.git***' 
3. Install the dependencies of the project by typing, '***npm install***' in the repository you just cloned
4. Then start the development server up with the following command, 
5. '***npm run serve***'
6. The website will be started on localhost with a default port of 8080, if you have a service running already on this port, then a different port will be chosen
7. Simply exit the command line to stop the localhost server
